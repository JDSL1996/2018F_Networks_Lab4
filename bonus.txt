Since ARP is a way to map IP addresses to MAC addresses, making this 
mistake would tell your computer to forward all packets intended for the
specified IP address to the defined MAC address despite it being incorrect.
The packets sent from your computer to that IP would therefore never reach
the intended IP address.
