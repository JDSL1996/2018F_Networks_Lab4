2)  A)  1) The 48-bit Ethernet address of my computer is: a8:86:dd:9a:e3:be
        2) The 48-bit Ethernet address of the destination is: b0:b2:8f:7d:73:1a
            No, this is the address of the network interface of the router that my 
            LAN is connecting and sending messages to.
        3) 0800 this corresponds to IPv4
        4) 67 bytes in
  
    B)  The ARP query is sent as a broadcast because the sender is unaware of which 
          adapter address matches the IP address. The response is send with a specific 
          destination because it does already know the adapter address as it just 
          received the message from there.
    
    C)  12) A) The opcode field begins 20 bytes from the beginning of the 
                Ethernet frame
            B) The value is 1 corresponding to a request
            C) Yes, the ARP message contains the IP address of the sender
            D) The target IP address is given at the very end of the ARP packet 
                and the MAC address is stored just before it waiting to be filled in
        13) A) The opcode field begins 20 bytes from the beginning of the 
                Ethernet frame
            B) the value is 2 corresponding to a reply
            C) The target IP address is given at the very end of the ARP packet 
                and the MAC address is stored just before it completely to be filled in
        14) The hexadecimal Value fot the Source: 00:06:25:da:af:73
            The hexadecimal Value fot the destination: 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68
        15) There is no reply because the closest router already has the MAC address 
              being requested so rather than wasting recourses the router just answers
    
    D) The default time an entry remains in the ARP cache for MAC OSLion is 20 minutes
